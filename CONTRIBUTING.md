EventFlow still needs a lot of love and if you want to help out there are
several areas that you could help out with.

* **Features:** If you have a great idea for EventFlow, create a pull request.
   It might be a finished idea or just some basic concepts showing the feature
   outline
* **Pull request feedback:** Typically there are several pull requests marked
   with the `in progress` and feedback is always welcome. Please note that the
   quality of the code here might not be "production ready", especially if
   the pull request is marked with the `prof of concept` label
* **Documentation:** Good documentation is very important for any library and
   is also very hard to do properly, so if spot a spelling error, think up
   a good idea for a guide or just have some comments, then please create
   either a pull request or an issue
* **Information sharing:** Working with CQRS+ES and DDD is hard, so if you come

   point to specfic EventFlow functionality that might be done better, then
   please create an issue or ask in the Gitter chat

  shipping example found in the code base, the please create a pull request
  or create an issue
  * Give a good understanding of how to use EventFlow
  * Give a better understanding of how API changes in EventFlow affect
    existing applications
