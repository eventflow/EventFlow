# Read model stores

In order to create query handlers that perform and enable them search across
multiple fields, read models or projections are used.

Read models are a flattened views of a subset or all aggregate domain events
created specifically for efficient queries.

Here's a simple example of how a read model for doing searches for usernames
could look. The read model handles the `UserCreated` domain event event to get
the username and user ID.

```csharp
public class UserReadModel : IReadModel,
  IAmReadModelFor<UserAggregate, UserId, UserCreated>
{
  public string UserId { get; set; }
  public string Username { get; set; }

  public void Apply(
    IReadModelContext context,
    IDomainEvent<UserAggregate, UserId, UserCreated> domainEvent)
  {
    UserId = domainEvent.AggregateIdentity.Value;
    Username = domainEvent.AggregateEvent.Username.Value;
  }
}
```

## Read model locators

Typically the ID of read models are the aggregate identity, but sometimes this
isn't the case. Here are some examples.

- Items from a collection on the aggregate root
- Deterministic ID created from event data
- Entity within the aggregate

To create read models in these cases, use the EventFlow concept of read model
locators, which is basically a mapping from a domain event to a read model ID.

As an example, consider if we could add several nicknames to a user. We might
have a domain event called `UserNicknameAdded` similar to this.

```csharp
public class UserNicknameAdded : AggregateEvent<UserAggregate, UserId>
{
  public Nickname Nickname { get; set; }
}
```

We could then create a read model locator that would return the ID for each
nickname we add via the event like this.

```csharp
public class UserNicknameReadModelLocator : IReadModelLocator
{
  public IEnumerable<string> GetReadModelIds(IDomainEvent domainEvent)
  {
    var userNicknameAdded = domainEvent as
      IDomainEvent<UserAggregate, UserId, UserNicknameAdded>;
    if (userNicknameAdded == null)
    {
      yield break;
    }

    yield return userNicknameAdded.Nickname.Id;
  }
}
```

And then use a read model similar to this that represent each nickname.

```csharp
public class UserNicknameReadModel : IReadModel,
  IAmReadModelFor<UserAggregate, UserId, UserNicknameAdded>
{
  public string UserId { get; set; }
  public string Nickname { get; set; }

  public void Apply(
    IReadModelContext context,
    IDomainEvent<UserAggregate, UserId, UserCreated> domainEvent)
  {
    UserId = domainEvent.AggregateIdentity.Value;
    Nickname = domainEvent.AggregateEvent.Nickname.Value;
  }
}
```

We could then use this nickname read model to query all the nicknames for a
given user by search for read models that have a specific `UserId`.

## Read store implementations

EventFlow has built-in support for several different read model stores.

### In-memory

The in-memory read store is easy to use and easy to configure. All read models
are stored in-memory, so if EventFlow is restarted all read models are lost.

To configure the in-memory read model store, simply call
`UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<>` or `UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<,>` with your read
model as the generic argument.

```csharp
var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
  ...
  .UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<UserReadModel>()
  .UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<UserNicknameReadModel,UserNicknameReadModelLocator>()
  ...
  .CreateResolver();
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

To configure the MSSQL read model store, simply call
`UseMssqlReadModel<>` or `UseMssqlReadModel<,>` with your read
model as the generic argument.

```csharp
var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
  ...
  .UseMssqlReadModel<UserReadModel>()
  .UseMssqlReadModel<UserNicknameReadModel,UserNicknameReadModelLocator>()
  ...
  .CreateResolver();
```

By convention, EventFlow uses the table named `ReadModel-[CLASS NAME]` as the
table to store the read models rows in. If you need to change this, use the
`Table` from the `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema` namespace. So
in the above example, the read model `UserReadModel` would be stored in
a table called `ReadModel-UserReadModel` unless stated otherwise.

To allow EventFlow to find the read models stored, a single column is required
to have the `MsSqlReadModelIdentityColumn` attribute. This will be used to
store the read model ID.

You should also create a `int` column that has the `MsSqlReadModelVersionColumn`
attribute to tell EventFlow which column is used to store the read model version
in.

**NOTE:** EventFlow expect the read model to exist, and thus any maintenance of
the database schema for the read models must be handled before EventFlow is
initialized. Or, at least before the read models are used in EventFlow.

### Elasticsearch

To configure the [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
read model store, simply call `UseElasticsearchReadModel<>` or
`UseElasticsearchReadModel<,>` with your read model as the generic argument.

```csharp
var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
  ...
  .ConfigureElasticsearch(new Uri("http://localhost:9200/"))
  ...
  .UseElasticsearchReadModel<UserReadModel>()
  .UseElasticsearchReadModel<UserNicknameReadModel,UserNicknameReadModelLocator>()
  ...
  .CreateResolver();
```

Overloads of `ConfigureElasticsearch(...)` is available for alternative
Elasticsearch configurations.

Make sure to create any mapping the read model requires in Elasticsearch
_before_ using the read model in EventFlow.

If EventFlow is requested to _purge_ a specific read model, it does it by
deleting the index. Thus make sure to create one separate index per read
model.

If you want to control the index a specific read model is stored in, create
create an implementation of `IReadModelDescriptionProvider` and register it
in the [EventFlow IoC](./Customize.md).
