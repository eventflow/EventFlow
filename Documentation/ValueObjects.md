# Event serialization and value objects

One of the important parts the creating a event sourced application, is to
ensure that you always can read your event streams. It seems simple enough, but
it is a problem, especially for with large applications that undergo refactoring
or domain changes.

The basic idea is to store events in a structure that's easy to access and
migrate if the need should arise. EventFlow, like many other event sourced
systems, stores its event using JSON.

## Making pretty and clean JSON

You might wonder "but, why?", and the reason is somewhat similar to the
reasoning behind [semantic URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_URL).

Consider the following value object used to validate and contain usernames in
an application.

```csharp
public class Username
{
  public string Value { get; }

  public Username(string value)
  {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || value.Length <= 4)
    {
      throw DomainError.With($"Invalid username '{value}'");
    }

    Value = value;
  }
}
```

First we do some cleanup and re-write it using EventFlows `SingleValueObject<>`.

```csharp
public class Username : SingleValueObject<string>
{
  public Username(string value) : base(value)
  {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || value.Length <= 4)
    {
      throw DomainError.With($"Invalid username '{value}'");
    }
  }
}
```

Now it looks simple and we might think we can use this value object directly
in our domain events. We could, but the resulting JSON will look like this.

```json
{
  "Username" : {
    "Value": "my-awsome-username",
  }
}
```

This doesn't look very good. First, that extra property doesn't make it easier
to read and it takes up more space when serializing and transmitting the event.

In addition, if you use the value object on a web API, people using the API
will need to wrap the properties in their DTOs in a similarly. What we would
like is to have our serialized event to look like this instead and still use
the value object in our events.

```json
{
  "Username" : "my-awsome-username"
}
```

To do this, we use the custom JSON serializer EventFlow has for single value
objects called `SingleValueObjectConverter` on our `Username` class like this.

```csharp
[JsonConverter(typeof(SingleValueObjectConverter))] // Only this line added
public class Username : SingleValueObject<string>
{
  public Username(string value) : base(value)
  {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value) || value.Length <= 4)
    {
      throw DomainError.With($"Invalid username '{value}'");
    }
  }
}
```

The JSON converter understands the single value object and will serialize and
deserialize it correctly.

Using this converter also enables to you replace e.g. raw `string` and `int`
properties with value objects on existing events as they will be
"JSON compatible".

**Note:** Consider applying this to any classes that inherit from `Identity<>`.
