# Subscribers
Whenever your application needs to act when a specific event is emitted from
your domain you create a class that implement one of the following two
interfaces which is.

- `ISubscribeSynchronousTo<TAggregate,TIdentity,TEvent>`: Executed synchronous
- `ISubscribeAsynchronousTo<TAggregate,TIdentity,TEvent>`: Executed asynchronous

Any implemented subscribers needs to be registered to this interface, either
using `AddSubscriber(...)`, `AddSubscribers(...)` or `AddDefaults(...)` during
initialization. If you have configured a custom IoC container, you can register
the implementations using it instead.

**NOTE:** The _synchronous_ and _asynchronous_ here has nothing to do with the
.NET framework keywords `async`, `await` or the Task Parallel Library. It
refers to how the subscribers are executed. Read below for details.

## Synchronous subscribers

Synchronous subscribers in EventFlow are executed one at a time for each
emitted domain event in order. This e.g. guarantees that all subscribers have
been executed when the `ICommandBus.PublishAsync(...)` returns.

The `ISubscribeSynchronousTo<,,>` is shown here.

```csharp
public interface ISubscribeSynchronousTo<TAggregate, in TIdentity, in TEvent>
    where TAggregate : IAggregateRoot<TIdentity>
    where TIdentity : IIdentity
    where TEvent : IAggregateEvent<TAggregate, TIdentity>
{
  Task HandleAsync(
    IDomainEvent<TAggregate, TIdentity, TEvent> domainEvent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

As synchronous subscribers are by their very nature executed synchronously,
emitting multiple events from an aggregate and letting subscribers publish new
commands based on this can however lead to some unexpected behavior as
"innermost" subscribers will be executed before first.

1. Aggregate emits events `Event 1` and `Event 2`
1. Subscriber handles `Event 1` and publishes a command that results in
   `Event 3` being emitted
   1. Subscriber handles `Event 3` (doesn't affect the domain)
1. Subscriber handles `Event 2`

In the above example the subscriber will handle the events in the following
order `Event 1`, `Event 3` and then `Event 2`. While this _could_ occur in
a distributed system or executing subscribers on different threads, its a
certainty when using synchronous subscribers.

**IMPORTANT:** By default any exceptions thrown by a subscriber are
__swallowed__ by EventFlow after it has been logged as an error. Depending on
the application this might be the preferred behavior, but in some cases it isn't.
If subscriber exception should be thrown, and thus allowing them to be caught in
e.g. command handlers, the behaivor can be disabled by setting the
`ThrowSubscriberExceptions` to `true` like illustrated here.

```csharp
using (var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
  .Configure(c => c.ThrowSubscriberExceptions = true)
  .CreateResolver())
{
  ...
}
```

## Asynchronous subscribers

Asynchronous subscribers in EventFlow are executed using the `ITaskRunner`
which is basically a thin wrapper around `Task.Run(...)` and thus any
number of asynchronous subscribers might still be running when a
`ICommandBus.PublishAsync(...)` returns.

There are _no_ guaranteed order between subscribers or even the order of which
emitted domain events are handled.

The `ISubscribeAsynchronousTo<,,>` is shown here and is, besides its name,
identical to its synchronous counterpart.

```csharp
public interface ISubscribeAsynchronousTo<TAggregate, in TIdentity, in TEvent>
    where TAggregate : IAggregateRoot<TIdentity>
    where TIdentity : IIdentity
    where TEvent : IAggregateEvent<TAggregate, TIdentity>
{
  Task HandleAsync(
    IDomainEvent<TAggregate, TIdentity, TEvent> domainEvent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

**NOTE:** Setting `ThrowSubscriberExceptions = true` has **no effect** on
asynchronous subscribers.
