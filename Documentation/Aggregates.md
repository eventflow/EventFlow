# Aggregates

Initially before you can create a aggregate, you need to create its
identity. You can create your own implementation by implementing
the `IIdentity` interface or you can use a base class `Identity<>` that
EventFlow provides, like this.

```csharp
public class TestId : Identity<TestId>
{
  public TestId(string value) : base(value)
  {
  }
}
```

The [`Identity<>`](./Documentation/Identity.md) value object provides generic
functionality to create and validate aggregate root IDs. Please read the
documentation regarding the bundled `Identity<>` type as it provides several
useful features, e.g. several different schemes for ID generation, one
that minimizes MSSQL database fragmentation.

Next, to create a new aggregate, simply inherit from `AggregateRoot<,>` like
this, making sure to pass test aggregate own type as the first generic
argument and the identity as the second.

```csharp
public class TestAggregate : AggregateRoot<TestAggregate, TestId>
{
  public TestAggregate(TestId id)
    : base(id)
  {
  }
}
```

## Events

In an event source system like EventFlow, aggregate root data are stored on
events.

```csharp
public class PingEvent : AggregateEvent<TestAggregate, TestId>
{
  public string Data { get; }
  public PingEvent(string data)
  {
      Data = data;
  }
}
```

Please make sure to read the section on
[value objects and events](./ValueObjects.md) for some important notes on
creating events.

## Emitting events

In order to emit an event from an aggregate, call the `protected`
`Emit(...)` method which applies the event and adds it to the list of
uncommitted events.

```csharp
public void Ping(string data)
{
  // Fancy domain logic here that validates aggregate state...

  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(data))
  {
    throw DomainError.With("Ping data empty")
  }

  Emit(new PingEvent(data))
}
```

Remember not to do any changes to the aggregate with the these methods, as
as state are only stored through events and how they are applied to the
aggregate root.

## Applying events

Currently EventFlow has three methods of applying events to the aggregate when
emitted or loaded from the event store. Which you choose is up to you,
implementing `IEmit<SomeEvent>` is the most convenient, but will expose
public `Apply` methods.

- Create a method called `Apply` that takes the event as argument. To get the
  method signature right, implement the `IEmit<SomeEvent>` on your aggregate.
  This is the default fallback and you will get an exception if no other
  strategies are configured. Although you _can_ implement `IEmit<SomeEvent>`,
  its optional, the `Apply` methods can be `protected` or `private`
- Create a state object by inheriting from `AggregateState<,,>` and registering
  using the protected `Register(...)` in the aggregate root constructor
- Register a specific handler for a event using the protected
  `Register<SomeEvent>(e => Handler(e))` from within the constructor
- Register an event applier using `Register(IEventApplier eventApplier)`,
  which could be a e.g state object
