Event stores
============

By default EventFlow uses a in-memory event store. But EventFlow provides
support for alternatives.

- :ref:`In-memory <eventstore-inmemory>` (for test)
- :ref:`Microsoft SQL Server <eventstore-mssql>`
- :ref:`Files <eventstore-files>` (for test)


.. _eventstore-inmemory:

In-memory
---------

.. IMPORTANT::

    Not for production use!


Using the in-memory event store is easy as its enabled by default, no need
to do anything.


.. _eventstore-mssql:

MSSQL event store
-----------------

See :ref:`MSSQL setup <setup-mssql>` for details on how to get started
using Microsoft SQL Server in EventFlow.

Configure EventFlow to use MSSQL as event store, simply add the
``UseMssqlEventStore()`` as shown here.

.. code-block:: c#

    IRootResolver rootResolver = EventFlowOptions.New
      ...
      .UseMssqlEventStore()
      ...
      .CreateResolver();


Create and migrate required MSSQL databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can use the MSSQL event store, the required database and
tables must be created. The database specified in your MSSQL connection
will *not* be automatically created, you have to do this yourself.

To make EventFlow create the required tables, execute the following
code.

.. code-block:: c#

    var msSqlDatabaseMigrator = rootResolver.Resolve<IMsSqlDatabaseMigrator>();
    EventFlowEventStoresMsSql.MigrateDatabase(msSqlDatabaseMigrator);


You should do this either on application start or preferably upon
application install or update, e.g., when the web site is installed.

.. IMPORTANT::

    If you utilize user permission in your application, then you
    need to grant the event writer access to the user defined table type
    ``eventdatamodel_list_type``. EventFlow uses this type to pass entire
    batches of events to the database.


.. _eventstore-files:

Files
-----

.. IMPORTANT::

    Not for production use!


The file based event store is useful if you have a set of events that represents
a certain scenario and would like to create a test that verifies that the domain
handles it correctly.

To use the file based event store, simply invoke ``.UseFilesEventStore`("...")``
with the path containing the files.

.. code-block:: c#

    var storePath = @"c:\eventstore"
    var rootResolver = EventFlowOptions.New
      ...
      .UseFilesEventStore(FilesEventStoreConfiguration.Create(storePath))
      ...
      .CreateResolver();
