# Sagas

To coordinates messages between bounded contexts and aggregates EventFlow
provides a simple saga system.

* **Saga identity**
* **Saga**
* **Saga locator**
* **Zero or more aggregates**

This example is based on the chapter "A Saga on Sagas" from the
[CQRS Journey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591569.aspx) by
Microsoft, in which we want to model the process of placing an order.

1. User sends command `PlaceOrder` to the `OrderAggregate`
1. `OrderAggregate` emits an `OrderCreated` event
1. `OrderSaga` handles `OrderCreated` by sending a `MakeReservation` command
   to the `ReservationAggregate`
1. `ReservationAggregate` emits a `SeatsReserved` event
1. `OrderSaga` handles `SeatsReserved` by sending a `MakePayment` command
   to the `PaymentAggregate`
1. `PaymentAggregate` emits a `PaymentAccepted` event
1. `OrderSaga` handles `PaymentAccepted` by emitting a `OrderConfirmed` event
   with all the details, which via subscribers updates the user, the
   `OrderAggregate` and the `ReservationAggregate`

Next we need an `ISagaLocator` which basically maps domain events to a saga
identity allowing EventFlow to find it in its store.

In our case we will add the order ID to event metadata of all events related to
a specific order.

```csharp
public class OrderSagaLocator : ISagaLocator
{
  public Task<ISagaId> LocateSagaAsync(
    IDomainEvent domainEvent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    var orderId = domainEvent.Metadata["order-id"];
    var orderSagaId = new OrderSagaId($"ordersaga-{orderId}");

    return Task.FromResult<ISagaId>(orderSagaId);
  }
}
```

Alternatively the order identity could be added to every domain event emitted
from the `OrderAggregate`, `ReservationAggregate` and `PaymentAggregate`
aggregates that the `OrderSaga` subscribes to, but this would depend on whether
or not the order identity is part of the ubiquitous language for your domain.

```csharp
public class OrderSaga
  : AggregateSaga<OrderSaga, OrderSagaId, OrderSagaLocator>,
    ISagaIsStartedBy<OrderAggregate, OrderId, OrderCreated>
{
  public Task HandleAsync(
      IDomainEvent<OrderAggregate, OrderId, OrderCreated> domainEvent,
      ISagaContext sagaContext,
      CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    // Update saga state with useful details.
    Emit(new OrderStarted(/*...*/));

    // Make the reservation
    Publish(new MakeReservation(/*...*/));
  }

  public void Apply(OrderStarted e)
  {
    // Update our aggregate state with relevant order details
  }
}
```

**Important:** Even though the method for publishing commands is named
`Publish`, the commands are only published to the command bus __after__ the
aggregate has been successfully committed to the event store (just like events).
If an unexpected exception is throw by this command publish, it should be
handled by a custom implementation of `ISagaErrorHandler`.

The next few events and commands are omitted, but at last the `PaymentAggregate`
emits its `PaymentAccepted` event and the saga completes and emit the final
`OrderConfirmed` event.

```csharp
public class OrderSaga
  : AggregateSaga<OrderSaga, OrderSagaId, OrderSagaLocator>,
    ...
    ISagaHandles<PaymentAggregate, PaymentId, PaymentAccepted>
{

  ...

  public Task HandleAsync(
      IDomainEvent<PaymentAggregate, PaymentId, PaymentAccepted> domainEvent,
      ISagaContext sagaContext,
      CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    Emit(new OrderConfirmed(/*...*/))
  }

  public void Apply(OrderConfirmed e)
  {
    // As this is the last event, we complete the saga by calling Complete()
    Complete();
  }
}
```

**NOTE:** An `AggregateSaga<,,>` is only considered in its `running` state if
there has been an event and it hasn't been marked as completed (by invoking the
`protected` `Complete()` method on the `AggregateSaga<,,>`).


## Alternative saga store

By default EventFlow is configured to use event sourcing and aggregate roots
for storage of sagas. However, you can implement your own storage system by
implementing `ISagaStore` and registering it.
