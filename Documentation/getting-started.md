# Getting started

Initializing EventFlow always starts with a call to the `AddEventFlow(ef => {})` extension method as this performs the initial bootstrap and starts the fluent configuration API.

```csharp
var services = new ServiceCollection();
services.AddEventFlow(ef => ef.AddDefaults(typeof(Startup).Assembly));
using var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
```

The above line configures several important defaults:

- In-memory [event store](integration/event-stores.md)
- A "null" snapshot store, that merely writes a warning if used (no need to do anything before going to production if you aren't planning to use snapshots)
- And lastly, default implementations of all the internal parts of EventFlow

!!! tip
    If you are setting up small tests, it's possible to use the shorthand `EventFlowOptions.New` to get an already initialized `IServiceCollection` instance that can be used for further configuration. This should only be used for testing and not in production code.

To start using EventFlow, a domain must be configured which consists of the following parts:

- [Aggregate](basics/aggregates.md)
- [Aggregate identity](basics/identity.md)
- [Aggregate events](basics/aggregates.md)
- [Commands and command handlers](basics/commands.md) (optional, but highly recommended)

In addition to the above, EventFlow provides several optional features. Whether or not these features are utilized depends on the application in which EventFlow is used.

- [Read models](integration/read-stores.md)
- [Subscribers](basics/subscribers.md)
- [Event upgraders](basics/event-upgrade.md)
- [Queries](basics/queries.md)
- [Jobs](basics/jobs.md)
- [Snapshots](additional/snapshots.md)
- [Sagas](basics/sagas.md)
- [Metadata providers](basics/metadata.md)

## Example application

The example application includes one of each of the required parts: aggregate, event, aggregate identity, command, and a command handler. Further down we will go through each of the individual parts.

All classes created for the example application are prefixed with `Example`.

```csharp
public class ExampleTests
{
  [Test]
  public async Task ExampleTest()
  {
    // Arrange
    var services = new ServiceCollection();
    services.AddEventFlow(ef => ef
      .AddDefaults(typeof(ExampleAggregate).Assembly)
      .UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<ExampleReadModel>());
    using var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

    var commandBus = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ICommandBus>();
    var queryProcessor = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IQueryProcessor>();
    var exampleId = ExampleId.New;

    // Act
    await commandBus.PublishAsync(new ExampleCommand(exampleId, 42), CancellationToken.None)
      .ConfigureAwait(false);
    var exampleReadModel = await queryProcessor.ProcessAsync(new ReadModelByIdQuery<ExampleReadModel>(exampleId), CancellationToken.None)
      .ConfigureAwait(false);

    // Assert
    exampleReadModel.MagicNumber.Should().Be(42);
  }
}
```

The above example publishes the `ExampleCommand` to the aggregate with the `exampleId` identity with the magical value of `42`. After the command has been published, the accompanying read model `ExampleReadModel` is fetched and we verify that the magical number has reached it.

During the execution of the example application, a single event is emitted and stored in the in-memory event store. The JSON for the event is shown here.

```json
{
  "MagicNumber": 42
}
```

The event data itself is straightforward as it is merely the JSON serialization of an instance of the type `ExampleEvent` with the value we defined. A bit more interesting is the metadata that EventFlow stores alongside the event, which is used by the EventFlow event store.

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2016-11-09T20:56:28.5019198+01:00",
  "aggregate_sequence_number": "1",
  "aggregate_name": "ExampleAggregate",
  "aggregate_id": "example-c1d4a2b1-c75b-4c53-ae44-e67ee1ddfd79",
  "event_id": "event-d5622eaa-d1d3-5f57-8023-4b97fabace90",
  "timestamp_epoch": "1478721389",
  "batch_id": "52e9d7e9-3a98-44c5-926a-fc416e20556c",
  "source_id": "command-69176516-07b7-4142-beaf-dba82586152c",
  "event_name": "example",
  "event_version": "1"
}
```

All the built-in metadata is available on each instance of `IDomainEvent<,,>`, which is accessible from event handlers for e.g. read models or subscribers. It is also possible to create your own [metadata providers](basics/metadata.md) or add additional EventFlow built-in providers as needed.

## Aggregate identity

The aggregate ID in EventFlow is represented as a value object that inherits from the `IIdentity` interface. You can provide your own implementation, but EventFlow provides a convenient implementation that will suit most needs. Be sure to read the section about the [Identity<>](basics/identity.md) class for details on how to use it.

For our example application, we use the built-in class, which makes the implementation very simple.

```csharp
public class ExampleId : Identity<ExampleId>
{
  public ExampleId(string value) : base(value) { }
}
```

## Aggregate

Now we'll take a look at the `ExampleAggregate`. It is rather simple as the only thing it can do is apply the magic number once.

```csharp
public class ExampleAggregate : AggregateRoot<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId>,
  IEmit<ExampleEvent>
{
  private int? _magicNumber;

  public ExampleAggregate(ExampleId id) : base(id) { }

  public IExecutionResult SetMagicNumber(int magicNumber)
  {
    if (_magicNumber.HasValue)
    {
      return ExecutionResult.Failed("Magic number already set");
    }

    Emit(new ExampleEvent(magicNumber));
    return ExecutionResult.Success();
  }

  public void Apply(ExampleEvent aggregateEvent)
  {
    _magicNumber = aggregateEvent.MagicNumber;
  }
}
```

Be sure to read the section on [aggregates](basics/aggregates.md) to get all the details right. For now, the most important thing to note is that the state of the aggregate (updating the `_magicNumber` variable) happens in the `Apply(ExampleEvent)` method. This is the event sourcing part of EventFlow in effect. As state changes are only saved as events, mutating the aggregate state must happen in such a way that the state changes are replayed the next time the aggregate is loaded. EventFlow has a [set of different approaches](basics/aggregates.md) that you can select from. In this example, we use the `Apply` methods as they are the simplest.

!!! info
    The `Apply(ExampleEvent)` is invoked by the `Emit(...)` method, so after the event has been emitted, the aggregate state has changed.

The `ExampleAggregate` exposes the `SetMagicNumber(int)` method, which is used to expose the business rules for changing the magic number. If the magic number hasn't been set before, the event `ExampleEvent` is emitted and the aggregate state is mutated.

If the magic number was changed, we return a failed `IExecutionResult` with an error message. Returning a failed execution result will make EventFlow disregard any events the aggregate has emitted.

If you need to return something more useful than a `bool` in an execution result, merely create a new class that implements the `IExecutionResult` interface and specify the type as generic arguments for the command and command handler.

!!! tip
    While possible, do not use the execution results as a method of reading values from the aggregate, that's what the `IQueryProcessor` and read models are for.

## Event

Next up is the event which represents something that **has** happened in our domain. In this example, it's merely that some magic number has been set. Normally these events should have a really, really good name and represent something in the ubiquitous language for the domain.

```csharp
[EventVersion("example", 1)]
public class ExampleEvent : AggregateEvent<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId>
{
  public ExampleEvent(int magicNumber)
  {
    MagicNumber = magicNumber;
  }

  public int MagicNumber { get; }
}
```

We have applied the `[EventVersion("example", 1)]` to our event, marking it as the `example` event version `1`, which directly corresponds to the `event_name` and `event_version` from the metadata stored alongside the event mentioned. The information is used by EventFlow to tie the name and version to a specific .NET type.

!!! warning
    Even though using the `EventVersion` attribute is optional, it is **highly recommended**. EventFlow will infer the information if it isn't provided, thus making it vulnerable to type renames among other things.

!!! danger
    Once you have aggregates in your production environment that have emitted an event, you should never change the .NET implementation of the event! You can deprecate it, but you should never change the type or the data stored in the event store. If the event type is changed, EventFlow will not be able to deserialize the event and can produce unexpected results when reading old aggregates.

    To handle changes to events, you can use [event upgraders](basics/event-upgrade.md).

## Command

Commands are the entry point to the domain and if you remember from the example application, they are published using the `ICommandBus` as shown here.

```csharp
await commandBus.PublishAsync(new ExampleCommand(exampleId, 42), CancellationToken.None)
  .ConfigureAwait(false);
```

In EventFlow, commands are simple value objects that merely house the arguments for the command execution. All commands implement the `ICommand<,>` interface, but EventFlow provides an easy-to-use base class that you can use.

```csharp
public class ExampleCommand : Command<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId>
{
  public ExampleCommand(ExampleId aggregateId, int magicNumber)
    : base(aggregateId)
  {
    MagicNumber = magicNumber;
  }

  public int MagicNumber { get; }
}
```

A command doesn't do anything without a command handler. In fact, EventFlow will throw an exception if a command doesn't have exactly **one** command handler registered.

## Command handler

The command handler provides the glue between the command, the aggregate, and the IoC container as it defines how a command is executed. Typically they are rather simple, but they could contain more complex logic. How much is up to you.

```csharp
public class ExampleCommandHandler : CommandHandler<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId, ExampleCommand>
{
  public override Task<IExecutionResult> ExecuteCommandAsync(
    ExampleAggregate aggregate,
    ExampleCommand command,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    return Task.FromResult(aggregate.SetMagicNumber(command.MagicNumber));
  }
}
```

The `ExampleCommandHandler` in our case here merely invokes the `SetMagicNumber` on the aggregate and returns the execution result. Remember, if a command handler returns a failed execution result, EventFlow will disregard any events the aggregate has emitted.

!!! warning
    Everything inside the `ExecuteCommandAsync(...)` method of a command handler **may** be executed more than once if there's an optimistic concurrency exception, i.e., something else has happened to the aggregate since it was loaded from the event store and it's therefore automatically reloaded by EventFlow. It is therefore essential that the command handler doesn't mutate anything other than the aggregate.

## Read model

If you ever need to access the data in your aggregates efficiently, it's important that [read models](integration/read-stores.md) are used. Loading aggregates from the event store takes time and it's impossible to query for e.g. aggregates that have a specific value in their state.

In our example, we merely use the built-in in-memory read model store. It is useful in many cases, e.g. executing automated domain tests in a CI build.

```csharp
public class ExampleReadModel : IReadModel,
  IAmReadModelFor<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId, ExampleEvent>
{
  public int MagicNumber { get; private set; }

  public Task ApplyAsync(
    IReadModelContext context,
    IDomainEvent<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId, ExampleEvent> domainEvent,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
  {
    MagicNumber = domainEvent.AggregateEvent.MagicNumber;
    return Task.CompletedTask;
  }
}
```

Notice the `IDomainEvent<ExampleAggregate, ExampleId, ExampleEvent> domainEvent` argument. It's merely a wrapper around the specific event we implemented earlier. The `IDomainEvent<,,>` provides additional information, e.g. any metadata stored alongside the event.

The main difference between the event instance emitted in the aggregate and the instance wrapped here is that the event has been committed to the event store.

## Next steps

Although the implementation in this guide enables you to create a complete application, there are several topics that are recommended as next steps.

- Read the [dos and don'ts](additional/dos-and-donts.md) section
- Use [value objects](additional/value-objects.md) to produce cleaner JSON
- If your application needs to act on an emitted event, create a [subscriber](basics/subscribers.md)
- Check the [configuration](additional/configuration.md) to make sure everything is as you would like it
- Set up a persistent event store using e.g. [Microsoft SQL Server](integration/mssql.md)
- Create [read models](integration/read-stores.md) for efficient querying
- Consider the use of [specifications](additional/specifications.md) to ease the creation of business rules
