# Migration guide 0.x to 1.x

EventFlow version 1 introduces carefully considered breaking API changes. Traditionally
EventFlow has a strict policy regarding stable APIs, with the introduction of
the 1 release, it is the first time any breaking change has been made to the
public API surface.

Here is the general motivation for introducing breaking changes to EventFlow.

- The initial version of EventFlow had its own IoC and logger implementation,
  but with the introduction of the standardized `Microsoft.Extensions` packages,
  EventFlow's custom implementations are removed
- Focus on LTS versions of .NET (Core) and remove support .NET Framework as many
  of the new C# language features are not available here
- Fix misssssspelled API
- Add obviously missing async/await on critical methods
- Remove non-async methods wrapper methods related to the bundled `AsyncHelper`

# Data in event stores

Upgrading EventFlow should **never** break existing data in event stores, not even
between major versions. All data currently in event stores will work with 1.x
releases. However, it _might_ not be possible to do a rollback from 1.x to 0.x.


<!-- =========================================================================== -->
# Recommended strategy for migrating 0.x to 1.x

Here is a few recommendations that might be useful when planning the migration
of EventFlow from 0.x to 1.x. 

- Since there is no change to the underlying storage, creating a release that
  only has EventFlow upgraded is highly recommended. This enables easy rollback
  if you encounter unexpected problems. Do note that rollback is not guaranteed
  to work safely, but *should* work. Please test it before proceeding with an
  upgrade
- Since the `IEventUpgrader<,>` has changed significantly, consider using the new
  base class `EventUpgraderNonAsync` in any existing upgraders. It provides an
  `abstract` method with the same signature as the old interface that can be
  overridden, making the switch significantly easier


<!-- =========================================================================== -->
# Notable new features in version 1

While the main focus of version 1 is to bring EventFlow up to speed with the latest
standards, there some changes/features that has been added as well. Features
that was not possible to add before as introducing them would cause breaking changes.


## Multiple MSSQL connection strings

It is now possible to have read models
outside the main database by adding a `[SqlReadModelConnectionStringName]`
attribute to the read models. The named connection string is then used for
that read model. To configure the named connection strings, provide them
during the initial configuration.

```csharp
MsSqlConfiguration.New
  .SetConnectionString(/* events connection string */)
  .SetConnectionString("my-awesome-read-model", /* alternative connection string */)
```

If the connection string is not known at initialization, provide your own instance
of the `IMsSqlConfiguration` which now has a new method that allows reading connection
strings at runtime.

```csharp
  Task<string> GetConnectionStringAsync(
    Label label,
    string name,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken);
```

This allows for connection strings to be fetched runtime from external sources.

##  Event upgraders are now async and works with the read model populator

In version 0.x, event upgraders aren't applied when events are loaded and
re-populated to read models using the `IReadModelPopulator`. This is fixed for
version 1.x, which properly will require some change to upgraders if the
re-population feature is used.

## Changes to supported .NET versions

With the version 1 release, EventFlow limits the amount of supported .NET versions, to
that of official [.NET (Core) LTS versions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy).
Support for non-LTS versions will be limited, but do expect to have EventFlow lag a little
behind when cutting support on older versions.

As of the 1.0 release, EventFlow supports the following framework versions.

- `netstandard2.1`
- `netcoreapp3.1`
- `net6.0`

Note that this enabled the use of `IAsyncEnumerable` which is going to be a key driver
for some of the upcoming features of EventFlow. 

## NuGet packages removed

With the move toward the standardized Microsoft extensions packages and removal
of support for .NET Framework, there are a few NuGet packages that will no
longer be supported.

- `EventFlow.Autofac`
   
   Since EventFlow uses the new `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` for
   handling IoC, its possible to install the Autofac adapter package instead,
   thus rendering the package obsolete.

- `EventFlow.DependencyInjection`

  Since the standard dependency injection is now a first class citizen in the
  core package, this package is no longer needed.

- `EventFlow.Owin`

  OWIN support has been removed as ASP.NET Core is introduced.


## Aligning with Microsoft extension packages

Several types have been removed from EventFlow in order to align
with the Microsoft extension packages.

- `ILog` use `ILogger` from `Microsoft.Extensions.Logger.Abstractions`
- `IResolver` use `IServiceProvider`
  from `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions`


## Only one interface for read models

The interfaces `IAmAsyncReadModelFor` has replaced the original `IAmReadModelFor`
leaving only async interface to implement on read models.

Originally EventFlow only had the non-async version `IAmReadModelFor`, but as it
became evident that updating read models sometimes requires the invocation of 
async method, the interface `IAmAsyncReadModelFor` was introduces as not to create
any breaking changes. Now, we remove the one and only have one interface to
implement.


## Removal of non-async method

Several non-async methods have been removed as well as the
`EventFlow.Core.AsyncHelper` which was used to implement these methods
without introducing deadlocks when running in some .NET Framework
environments.

- `IAggregateStore.Load`
- `IAggregateStore.Store`
- `IAggregateStore.Update`
- `ICommandBus.Publish`
- `IEventStore.LoadAggregate`
- `IEventStore.LoadEvents`
- `IEventStore.LoadAllEvents`
- `IQueryProcessor.Process`
- `IReadModelPopulator.Populate`
- `IReadModelPopulator.Purge`


## Initializing EventFlow

Starting version 1, there are a few ways you can initialize EventFlow.


### Fluent as `IServiceCollection` extension

```csharp
serviceCollection.AddEventFlow(o => 
    // Set up EventFlow here
    );
```

### Traditionally passing a `IServiceCollection` reference

```csharp
var eventFlowOptions = EventFlowOptions.New(serviceCollection)

// Set up EventFlow here
```


### Let EventFlow create the `IServiceCollection`

Useful in small tests, but should **NOT** be used in production setups.

```csharp
var eventFlowOptions = EventFlowOptions.New()
// its a short hand for
// var eventFlowOptions = EventFlowOptions.New(new ServiceCollection())

// Set up EventFlow here
```
