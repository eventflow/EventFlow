EventFlow is a basic CQRS+ES framework designed to be easy to use.

Have a look at our [getting started guide](./Documentation/GettingStarted.md),
the [dos and don'ts](./Documentation/DoesAndDonts.md) and the
[FAQ](./Documentation/FAQ.md).

### Features

* **CQRS+ES framework**
* **Async/await first:** Every part of EventFlow is written using async/await. In
  some places EventFlow exposes sync methods like e.g. the `ICommandBus`, but these
  merely _try_ to do the right thing using an async bridge
* **Highly configurable and extendable**
* **Easy to use**
* **No use of threads or background workers making it "web friendly"**
* **Cancellation:** All methods that does IO work or might delay execution (due to
  retries), takes a `CancellationToken` argument to allow you to cancel the operation

### Overview

Here is a list of the EventFlow concepts. Use the links to navigate
to the documentation.

* [**Aggregates:**](./Documentation/Aggregates.md) Domains object
  that guarantees the consistency of changes being made within
  each aggregate
* [**Command bus and commands:**](./Documentation/Commands.md)
  Entry point for all command/operation execution.
* **Event store:** Storage of the event stream for aggregates.
  Currently there is support for these storage types.
 * In-memory - only for test
 * Files - only for test
 * [Microsoft SQL Server](./Documentation/EventStores-MSSQL.md)
 * EventStore - only for test (for now) [home page](https://geteventstore.com/)
* **Read models:** Denormalized representation of aggregate events
  optimized for reading fast. Currently there is support for these
  read model storage types.
  * In-memory - only for test
  * Microsoft SQL Server
* [**Queries:**](./Documentation/Queries.md) Value objects that represent
  a query without specifying how its executed, that is let to a query handler
* [**Event upgrade:**](./Documentation/EventUpgrade.md) As events committed to
  the event store is never changed, EventFlow uses the concept of event
  upgraders to deprecate events and replace them with new during aggregate load.
* **Event publishing:** Sometimes you want other applications or services to
  consume and act on domains. For this EventFlow supports event publishing.
 * [RabbitMQ](./Documentation/RabbitMQ.md)
* [**Metadata:**](./Documentation/Metadata.md)
  Additional information for each aggregate event, e.g. the IP of
  the user behind the event being emitted. EventFlow ships with
  several providers ready to use used.
* [**Value objects:**](./Documentation/ValueObjects.md) Data containing classes
  used to validate and hold domain data, e.g. a username or e-mail.
* [**Customize:**](./Documentation/Customize.md) Almost every single part of
  EventFlow can be swapped with a custom implementation through the embedded
  IoC container.

## Full example
Here's an example on how to use the in-memory event store (default)
and a in-memory read model store.

```csharp
using (var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
    .AddEvents(typeof (TestAggregate).Assembly)
    .AddCommandHandlers(typeof (TestAggregate).Assembly)
    .UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<TestAggregate, TestReadModel>()
    .CreateResolver())
{
  var commandBus = resolver.Resolve<ICommandBus>();
  var eventStore = resolver.Resolve<IEventStore>();
  var readModelStore = resolver.Resolve<IInMemoryReadModelStore<
    TestAggregate,
    TestReadModel>>();
  var id = TestId.New;

  // Publish a command
  await commandBus.PublishAsync(new PingCommand(id));

  // Load aggregate
  var testAggregate = await eventStore.LoadAggregateAsync<TestAggregate>(id);

  // Get read model from in-memory read store
  var testReadModel = await readModelStore.GetAsync(id);
}
```

Note: `.ConfigureAwait(false)` omitted in above example.

## State of EventFlow

EventFlow is still under development, especially the parts regarding
how read models are re-populated.

EventFlow  _is_ currently used in production environments and performs very well,
but it need to mature before key APIs are stable.

EventFlow is greatly opinionated, but its possible to create new implementations
for almost every part of EventFlow by registering a different implementation of a
a interface.

Many of the technical design decisions in EventFlow is based on articles. This
section lists some of them. If you have a link with a relevant article, please

## How to contribute

EventFlow still needs a lot of love and if you want to help out there are
several areas that you could help out with.

* **Features:** If you have a great idea for EventFlow, create a pull request.
   It might be a finished idea or just some basic concepts showing the feature
   outline
* **Pull request feedback:** Typically there are several pull requests marked
   with the `in progress` and feedback is always welcome. Please note that the
   quality of the code here might not be "production ready", especially if
   the pull request is marked with the `prof of concept` label
* **Documentation:** Good documentation is very important for any library and
   is also very hard to do properly, so if spot a spelling error, think up
   a good idea for a guide or just have some comments, then please create
   either a pull request or an issue
* **Information sharing:** Working with CQRS+ES and DDD is hard, so if you come
   across articles that might be relevant for EventFlow, or even better, can
   point to specfic EventFlow functionality that might be done better, then
   please create an issue or ask in the Gitter chat
