EventFlow is a basic CQRS+ES framework designed to be easy to use.

Have a look at our [Getting started guide](./Documentation/GettingStarted.md).

### Features

* CQRS+ES framework
* Async/await first
* Highly configurable and extendable
* Easy to use
* No use of threads or background workers making it "web friendly"
* Cancellation

### Overview

Here is a list of the EventFlow concepts. Use the links to navigate
to the documentation.

* [**Aggregates**](./Documentation/Aggregates.md): Domains object
  that guarantees the consistency of changes being made within
  each aggregate
* **Command bus:** Entry point for all command execution.
* **Event store:** Storage of the event stream for aggregates.
  Currently there is support for these storage types.
 * In-memory - only for test
 * Files - only for test
 * [Microsoft SQL Server](./Documentation/EventStores-MSSQL.md)
 * EventStore - only for test (for now) [home page](https://geteventstore.com/)
* **Read models:** Denormalized representation of aggregate events
  optimized for reading fast. Currently there is support for these
  read model storage types.
  * In-memory - only for test
  * Microsoft SQL Server
* [**Queries**](./Documentation/Queries.md): Value objects that represent
  a query without specifying how its executed, that is let to a query handler
* [**Event upgrade**](./Documentation/EventUpgrade.md): As events committed to
  the event store is never changed, EventFlow uses the concept of event upgraders
  to deprecate events and replace them with new during aggregate load.
* [**Metadata**](./Documentation/Metadata.md):
  Additional information for each aggregate event, e.g. the IP of
  the user behind the event being emitted. EventFlow ships with
  several providers ready to use used.
* [**Customize**](./Documentation/Customize.md): Almost every single part of
  EventFlow can be swapped with a custom implementation through the embedded
  IoC container.

## Full example
Here's an example on how to use the in-memory event store (default)
and a in-memory read model store.

```csharp
using (var resolver = EventFlowOptions.New
    .AddEvents(typeof (TestAggregate).Assembly)
    .AddCommandHandlers(typeof (TestAggregate).Assembly)
    .UseInMemoryReadStoreFor<TestAggregate, TestReadModel>()
    .CreateResolver())
{
  var commandBus = resolver.Resolve<ICommandBus>();
  var eventStore = resolver.Resolve<IEventStore>();
  var readModelStore = resolver.Resolve<IInMemoryReadModelStore<
    TestAggregate,
    TestReadModel>>();
  var id = TestId.New;

  // Publish a command
  await commandBus.PublishAsync(new PingCommand(id));

  // Load aggregate
  var testAggregate = await eventStore.LoadAggregateAsync<TestAggregate>(id);

  // Get read model from in-memory read store
  var testReadModel = await readModelStore.GetAsync(id);
}
```

Note: `.ConfigureAwait(false)` omitted in above example.

## State of EventFlow

EventFlow is still under development, especially the parts regarding
how read models are re-populated.

EventFlow  _is_ currently used in production environments and performs very well,
but it need to mature before key APIs are stable.

EventFlow is greatly opinionated, but its possible to create new implementations
for almost every part of EventFlow to registering a different implementation to
a interface.
